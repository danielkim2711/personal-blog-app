# My Personal Blog App

<br/>

This is a personal blog application built with the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js).

Addition to that, Tailwind CSS and daisyUI are used for the styles.

Users are not meant to create, update or delete a post, but they can freely view, create or delete a comment by setting up their personal name and password in the comment section.

This website is fully responsible to any screen sizes, and all passwords entered by users are safely salted and hashed by bcryptjs.
